This is my personal website, a place to share my thoughts and show off my portfolio.

## Getting Started

```
npm i
make clean serve
```

To package / deploy to my github pages:

```
make package
```

It isn't smart enough to generate a sitemap (yet), so I need to remember to [generate one](www.xml-sitemaps.com)

I like to validate the RSS with [this tool](https://validator.w3.org/feed/#validate_by_uri).

## Roadmap

- Automatic Sitemap Generation
