# I'm stuck.

Objetives:

- Explain the problem

I'm stuck.

I spend countless hours:
- Thinking up new projects.
- Starting them only getting 20% of the way.
- Getting stuck.

Reasons I'm Stuck:

Need to go outside of comfort zone:
- Do things differently than I'm used to.
- Learn new skills, whether life skills or programming skills.
- Change my habbits, how I spend my time, the things I prioritize in life.

Let go of my image / ego 
- People have told me I'm good and I'm afraid to show them that I'm not (I'm not).

Stop trying to make it perfect
- Instead of spending days designing, thinking about features, the perfect way to release, market and acquire customers I need to just do it.

I need to update my resume before I apply for a job.
I need to clean up my github before employers look at it.
I need to update my website before they see my portfolio.
- I need to add RSS to my website
- I need to have a site map.
- I need to update the content.
- I need to make sure the code is clean. 
- I need to have featurex.

Just fucking apply for the job.jj
