Hi I'm Jordan,


On paper I am currently:


- Instructor, Senior Full Stack Developer @ [Galvanize](http://galvanize.com)
- Owner of [Mad Titan Studios](http://madtitanstudios.com)
- Fearless leader of [Code for Foco](http://codeforfoco.org)


Ultimately, I'm passionate about making things. My spare time is spent creating, tinkering, hacking and modifying everything from websites to robots. I love IoT, robotics, 3d printing, linux, web development, application development, vr and video game development.
