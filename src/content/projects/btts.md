Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat was an experiment in collaboration with Emerson Stone, a product-focused design agency based out of Boulder.

Their talented artists drew a cartoon 360 degree view of the inside of a cockpit. Instead of drawing it on the inside of a sphere or other traditional ways of creating 360 content they decided to draw it as an equirectangular image.

They had built an A-Frame app so that you could use webvr to look at the image as if you were inside of the cockpit. It worked.

We wanted the scene to come to life.
