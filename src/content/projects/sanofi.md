Sanofi Holographic is an immersive story which takes users on a journey which demonstrates how augmented and virtual reality can be used for data visualization, therapeutics and pharmaceuticals.

I was responsible for implementation of game logic using both C# scripts and Unity's animator.

- Seamless, low memory asynchronous loading and unloading of scenes.
- Event handling for - Event handlinganimations, audio, transitions etc...
- Voice and gesture controls.

I also had a hand in integrating assets from our art team. Responsibilities included:

- Importing and optimizing 3D and other digital assets.
- Assigning and configuring custom materials to models.
- Ensuring meshes were low poly and animated well
- Compressing audio tracks to maintain high fidelity sound and low memory footprint.

Performance is critical, especially when on hardware as limited as the HoloLens. This project made use of custom shaders, GPU instanced meshes, mesh reduction, audio compression and other techniques to ensure a quality user experience.
