# Vroo Cofee

Launched Vroo Coffee today.

It has been a goal of mine for over a decade to launch a physical product and today I finally have. [vroo.coffee](https://vroo.coffee), top shelf coffee roast to order.

I'm a software engineer by trade, however I made a rule that I wasn't allowed to code. Instead, I needed to tackle this project as an entrepreneur in order to get out of my comfort zone and foster growth in skills that I am lacking.

I often get my projects to 80% then lose momentum when I get anxiety about imperfections or the possibility of failure. One of the goals of this project was to overcome that anxiety and launch even when things are far from perfect.

An imperfect product, continuously improved will take me farther than a perfect product never completed.

I'm excited to continue to grow and develop as a person as I continue to grow Vroo Coffee.
