# Solar Eclipse VR

![{"square-framed"}](/img/project/eclipse-tinyplanet.jpg)


During the 2017 eclipse I hucked a Nokia OZO up to Casper Mountain, WYO, to see if I could get any cool shots. Turns out I did! Unfortunately, the it is unlikely film will ever see the light of day due to complications with the team that owned the OZO. However, it was very fun and enlightening to work on a project outside my normal area of expertise.

It's healthy to do something different every now and again.
