A client proof of concept to demonstrate how virtual reality can be used for real-time interactive architectural visualization.

I was responsible for the whole project, but here are some specifics:
- Implementing gameplay logic in blueprints.
- Importing models into UE4 from Sketchup.
- Creating performant materials
- Reducing draw calls by consolidating materials.
