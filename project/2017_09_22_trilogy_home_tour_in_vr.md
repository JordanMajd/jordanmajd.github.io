Showcased at Breckenridge Film Festival, Trilogy Home brought Sketchup to life with Unreal Engine in partnership with HP and Trilogy Partners.

I was responsible for this entire client project, here are some of specifics I worked on:
- Implementing gameplay logic using custom blueprints.
- Creating performant materials, instancing matierals to reduce draw calls.
- Importing Sketchup assets into Unreal and optimizing the meshes.
- Scene lighting, ensuring the scene looked beautiful while retaining 60fps on target hardware.
- Performance profiling and optimization.
- Configuring graphics and forward rendering settings.
