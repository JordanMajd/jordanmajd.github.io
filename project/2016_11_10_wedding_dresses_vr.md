A client proof of concept developed in a single day to demonstrate how interactive 3D 360 video could be used for retail and e-commerce. Users were presented with a user interface to browse wedding dresses. When a user looked at a dress, a model would fade in wearing that dress and walk up to the user showing off the dress. This was implemented by overlaying several simultaneous transparent 4k streams while maintaining a high framerate on a cell phone.
