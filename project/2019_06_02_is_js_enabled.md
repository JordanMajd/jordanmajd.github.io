# Is JS Enabled

![Animated GIF showing the site with javascript enabled and disabled.](/img/project/is_js_enabled.gif)

I made an extension and needed to be able to quickly validate whether js was enabled. Surprisingly, there weren't any stupid simple websites to do that so I set out to make one. A few hours later [isjsenabled.com](https://isjsenabled.com/) was online.

I had a lot of fun carefully picking the colors, coding the site from scratch and stopping all work to solve a very tiny problem. It reminded me, there's nothing better than the feeling of having made something, no matter how small it is.

The project can be found on [github](https://github.com/jordanmajd/isjsenabled.com), pull requests are welcome.
