I've spent a lot of time thinking about designing and selling a keyboard. Finally, I decided to stop thinking about it and build a proof of concept to see if it is something that I want to pursue further. After a weekend of navigating poorly documented MCUs I hacked together a bluetooth stack and got a single key proof of concept running.

The prototype features:

- USB C
- BLE 5.0
- LiPo battery
- Qi Charging

My son wanted to join in on the fun, so we built him a 4 button one using a more traditional MCU:

After building out a prototype, I've ordered parts for proof of concept rev. II. You can track my progress @ [ttykeyboards.com](https://ttykeyboards.com).
