<p><a href="https://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/ansel">Ansel</a> is a toolkit by NVIDIA that enables users to take state of the art in game photographs. It comes with a rich feature set that overcomes the limitations of traditional screen capture methods. Ansel supports 360 and stereo screenshots, making it easy to create content for virtual reality. Super-resolution takes place on the graphics card, allowing users to break free from their 1080p monitors and capture screenshots at insane resolutions (I just took a 2.3 gigapixel screenshot!) Users have full camera control, can apply post processing filters, visual effects and take photos using HDR.</p>
<p>I’m going to walk you through how to add NVIDIA Ansel to your Unreal project and start taking absolutely stunning VR screenshots.</p>

<h2 id="1-ensure-your-computer-is-set-up-to-use-nvidia-ansel-">1. Ensure your computer is set up to use NVIDIA Ansel.</h2>
<p>In order to use Ansel your computer will need a compatible graphics card. For this you will need a NVIDIA GTX 780 or better running with GeForce 372.90 or newer drivers. If you aren’t sure if your card supports Ansel check out the <a href="https://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/ansel/supported-gpus">official list of supported graphics cards</a>.</p>
<p>You will need to be running Unreal Engine 4.14 or later. If you don’t have Unreal yet, you can find it on <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4">their website</a> with loads of resources on how to get started.</p>
<h2 id="2-load-up-a-project-in-unreal-editor-">2. Load up a project in Unreal Editor.</h2>
<p>Open up the project you are looking to capture. If you don’t have one ready that is fine too; Unreal provides a lot of AAA quality demos that you can use. I suggest using the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/infiltrator-demo">Infiltrator Demo</a> or <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/scifi-hallway">SciFi Hallway</a>, which are ready to run projects that can be downloaded from the Marketplace. Another option is to create a blank project and import other maps from the Marketplace, like the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/infinity-blade-plain-lands">Infinity Blade Grass Lands.</a></p>
<h2 id="3-enable-ansel-plugin-in-project-">3. Enable Ansel Plugin in project.</h2>
<p>Next we need to enable the the Ansel plugin in your project. To do this click on <code>Edit -&gt; Plugins</code>. From there you can navigate to the photography section and click on Ansel and enable it. After activating the plugin Unreal will need to be restarted.</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/360/360_plugin.png" alt="Enable Ansel in the Editor Plugins menu.">
<span class="subtitle">Enable Ansel in the Editor Plugins menu.</span></p>
<h2 id="4-configure-ansel-and-white-list-project-">4. Configure Ansel and white list project.</h2>
<p>Before we can start taking pictures, we need to make sure Ansel is configured for the current computer. Press <code>Win+R</code> to open the <code>Run</code> dialogue, then enter the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\Ansel\Tools\NvCameraConfiguration.exe
</code></pre>
<p>This will open up the <code>Ansel Configuration Utility</code>. You shouldn’t need to change much, just make sure <code>NvCamera Status</code> is <code>Enabled</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/360/360_config.png" alt="Set NvCamera Status to enabled in the Ansel Configuration Utility.">
<span class="subtitle">Set NvCamera Status to enabled in the Ansel Configuration Utility.</span></p>
<p>By default, Ansel is set up to only activate on white-listed games. Since development projects aren’t on the list we’ll run a command to white-list everything.</p>
<p>In order to do that we’re going to run the same command as before, but this time we will pass the <code>whitelisting-everything</code> argument to it. To do so, press <code>Win+R</code> to open up <code>Run</code>, then enter the text below:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\Ansel\Tools\NvCameraEnable.exe whitelisting-everything
</code></pre>
<p>This allows us to use Ansel in any game which supports it. If you ever want to undo this, run the same command as before but with the argument <code>whitelisting-default</code>.</p>
<h2 id="5-run-the-game-and-take-some-shots-">5. Run the game and take some shots.</h2>
<p>Now that you are all set up, let’s have some fun and take some shots. Go ahead and launch the game in standalone mode by pressing <strong>Play -&gt; Play Standalone Game</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/360/360_standalone.png" alt="Launch the game by pressing Play -&gt; Standalone Game.">
<span class="subtitle">Launch the game by pressing Play -&gt; Standalone Game.</span></p>
<p>Once the game has launched bring up the in-game Ansel menu by pressing <code>ALT+F2</code>. Depending how your computer is set up, things might look a little funky at this point. It just so happens that <code>F2</code> is the shortcut to disable real-time lighting in Unreal, so you will want to press <code>F3</code> to re-enable real-time lighting. In order to avoid this from happening in the future, you may want to change the keybindings for Ansel using the configuration utility we ran earlier.</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/360/360_settings.png" alt="Ansel’s in game GUI.">
<span class="subtitle">Ansel’s in game GUI.</span></p>
<p>Now that Ansel has launched, use WASD and your mouse to move the camera into the desired position, <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Plugins/Ansel/Testing/index.html">click here for a list of controls</a>. Once you have your shot lined up you may select various filters, visual effects and settings for your picture. I suggest to start off with 360 — if you plan viewing with a VR headset give stereo 360 a shot. Once you’ve lined up the perfect pic press the <strong>Snap</strong> button.</p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/360/360_snap.png" alt="Press snap to take a screenshot.">
<span class="subtitle">Press snap to take a screenshot.</span></p>
<p>Your screenshot will be located in your user’s video folder, for example if your username is <code>bobbarker</code> then your image will be at <code>C:\Users\bobbarker\Videos\UE4Editor</code>.</p>
<h2 id="6-what-s-next-">6. What’s next?</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve discovered the beauty of Ansel, what’s next?</p>

<p>You can view your art in VR, share your shots with friends and family using Facebook’s 360 image viewer, make a Tiny World pic and of course you could always <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanmajd">tweet</a> me your favorites.</p>
